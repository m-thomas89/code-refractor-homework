In this assignment I was able to change the "div" and make it a more specific tag.

I also added all the alt attributes for each of the photos to make it easier for google to find/read

* My first step was to take care of each of the photo's alt tags.
* Then I started working on the div tags and made sure the css file matched the new tags so it woud not mess up
* Next I made sure the title of the website was corrct and corresponds to what the website is about.
